# Exercise 5: dplyr grouped operations

# Install the `"nycflights13"` package. Load (`library()`) the package.
# You'll also need to load `dplyr`
#install.packages("nycflights13")  # should be done already
library("nycflights13")

# What was the average departure delay in each month?
# Save this as a data frame `dep_delay_by_month`
# Hint: you'll have to perform a grouping operation then summarizing your data
dep_delay_by_month <- flights %>% 
  group_by(month) %>% 
  summarize(
    average_delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE)
  )
  
# Which month had the greatest average departure delay?
dep_delay_by_month %>% 
  filter(average_delay == max(average_delay))

# If your above data frame contains just two columns (e.g., "month", and "delay"
# in that order), you can create a scatterplot by passing that data frame to the
# `plot()` function
plot(dep_delay_by_month)

# To which destinations were the average arrival delays the highest?
